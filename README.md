PiDP-8 testing &amp; utilities

Just some quick utilities I threw together to test the LEDs on my PiDP-8 kit. All of the programs rely on the include libraries in the root directory of the project (ledcontrol, ledlocations, pdpcontrol, and strcontrol).

HELLO
A simple "Hello World!" program that can be used as a basic LED test. It loops through turning on ALL of the LEDs and then a simple box animation.

LEDS-OFF
Sometimes during my testing I've had some LEDs get stuck on. This simple program turns off ALL of the LEDs.

MATRIX
Another simple menu-driven LED test program. It includes options to turn all of the LEDs on and off at once, single step through each LED in sequence, animate a chase sequence, and allow for a user-defined animation path.
